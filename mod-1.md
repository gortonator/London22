## Homework 1

Working in groups, select a paper from the [Journal of Information Technology Teaching Cases](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.neu.edu/loi/ttca) to present to class. The journal is available through the Snell Library.

The papers cover a wide range of business problems and solutions in IT. Ideally select a reasonably recent paper (last 2-3 years) and a business that is somewhat familiar to everyone. 

You should create a 10 minute maximum presentation that you can use to describe the key details in the paper. The exact structure of the presentation will depend on the paper you choose, but in general make sure you cover:

- What the business does
- What problem was the business attempting to solve or improve?
- What transformation was put in place? New technology? New business processes? New development processes?
- What was successful and/or unsuccessful?
- Any other points/issues you found particularly interesting?

**Deadline**: You will present at the start of the next class

**Points**: 5  (clarity or presentation, covering the key points listed above)
